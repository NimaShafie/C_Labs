### 1. Banker's Algorithm

Objective:
To implement resource allocation and demonstrate deadlock avoidance using the Banker's 
algorithm.

Specification:

The program simulates resource allocation to requesting processes and demonstrates deadlock 
avoidance with the Banker's algorithm. A menu controls the operations, and each choice calls 
the appropriate procedure, where the choices are: 
1) Enter parameters
2) Run the Banker's algorithm to determine a safe sequence
3) Quit program and free memory

### 2. Disk Scheduling
To compare the performance of disk scheduling algorithms:
First-in-first-out (FIFO), Shortest-seek-time-first (SSTF), Scan, and C-Scan.
