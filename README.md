## 1. Banker's Algorithm

Objective:
To implement resource allocation and demonstrate deadlock avoidance using the Banker's 
algorithm.

Specification:

The program simulates resource allocation to requesting processes and demonstrates deadlock 
avoidance with the Banker's algorithm. A menu controls the operations, and each choice calls 
the appropriate procedure, where the choices are: 
1) Enter parameters
2) Run the Banker's algorithm to determine a safe sequence
3) Quit program and free memory

## 2. Disk Scheduling
To compare the performance of disk scheduling algorithms:
First-in-first-out (FIFO), Shortest-seek-time-first (SSTF), Scan, and C-Scan.

## 3. Batch Process Scheduling

Objective: To calculate the timing parameters of batch processes based on different scheduling algorithms.

Specification: The program mimics the execution of different processes under different scheduling algorithms. The simulation maintains a table that reflects the current state of the system, based on choosing from a menu of choices, where each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:

Enter parameters
Schedule processes with FIFO algorithm
Schedule processes with SJF algorithm (non-preemptive)
Schedule processes with SRT algorithm (preemptive version of SJF)
Quit program and free memory
